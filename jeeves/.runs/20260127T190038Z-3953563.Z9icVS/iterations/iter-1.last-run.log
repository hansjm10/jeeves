I have completed the task. The design document for Issue #2 ("Create shared Vitest configuration package") has been drafted, and the issue configuration has been updated with the work breakdown.

**Summary of Actions:**
1.  **Analyzed Context:** Identified Issue #2 details ("Create shared Vitest configuration package") and inspected the existing codebase in `Idle-Game-Engine`.
2.  **Drafted Design Doc:** Created `docs/issue-2-design.md` proposing a new `@idle-engine/config-vitest` package to centralize test configuration, standardize coverage, and integrate `vitest-llm-reporter`.
3.  **Defined Tasks:** Extracted 4 tasks (`T1` to `T4`) covering scaffolding, logic implementation, migration of existing packages, and verification.
4.  **Updated Configuration:** Updated `jeeves/issue.json` with the design doc path, the extracted tasks, and initialized the task tracking state to `implement`.
5.  **Logged Progress:** Appended a completion entry to `jeeves/progress.txt`.

**Output Artifacts:**
-   `docs/issue-2-design.md`: The detailed design document.
-   `jeeves/issue.json`: Updated with tasks and status.
-   `jeeves/progress.txt`: Updated log.
