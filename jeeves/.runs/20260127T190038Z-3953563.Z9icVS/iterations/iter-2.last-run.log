I have completed the task T1 "feat(config-vitest): scaffold package".

**Summary of Actions:**
1.  **Context:** Verified project structure and git status. Switched to branch `issue/2-design`.
2.  **Implementation:**
    -   Verified `packages/config-vitest` existence.
    -   Created a verification script to check for missing dependencies (`vitest`, `vitest-llm-reporter`) which were only listed as `peerDependencies`.
    -   Added `vitest` and `vitest-llm-reporter` as explicit `dependencies` to `packages/config-vitest/package.json` to satisfy the task requirements and ensure consumers (and the package itself) have access to them.
    -   Verified the installation with the script.
3.  **Commit:** Committed changes with message "feat(config-vitest): scaffold package (#2)".
4.  **PR:** Created Pull Request #861 targeting `main`.
5.  **State Update:**
    -   Updated `jeeves/issue.json`: Set `taskStage` to `spec-review`, `prCreated` to `true`, and recorded PR URL.
    -   Updated `jeeves/progress.txt`: Logged T1 completion and PR creation.

The task is now in the `spec-review` stage.
