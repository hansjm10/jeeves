- When searching across file contents to find where something is implemented, you MUST use MCP pruner search tools first when pruner is available in the current phase (for example `mcp:pruner/grep` with `context_focus_question`).
- When you already know the exact file/path to inspect, you MUST use the MCP pruner `read` tool when it is available in the current phase.
- Shell-based file search/read commands are fallback-only when pruner tools are unavailable or insufficient. If you use shell fallback, note the reason in your response/progress output.
