# Skill Registry Configuration
# Maps workflow phases to skill sets for phase-based skill provisioning.
#
# Skills are resolved in order:
# 1. Common skills (always included)
# 2. Phase-specific skills (exact phase name match)
# 3. Phase-type defaults (fallback if phase not explicitly mapped)

# Schema version for future compatibility
version: 1

# Skills available to all phases
common:
  - jeeves

# Phase-specific skill mappings
# Keys are phase names from workflow YAML (e.g., design_draft, implement_task)
phases:
  design_draft: []
  design_review: []
  design_edit: []
  implement_task: []
  task_spec_check: []
  code_review: []
  code_fix: []

# Phase type defaults (fallback if phase not explicitly listed)
# Keys match PhaseType enum values: execute, evaluate, script, terminal
phase_type_defaults:
  execute: []
  evaluate: []
  script: []
  terminal: []
